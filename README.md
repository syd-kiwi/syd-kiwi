## 💡 About Me

I'm a passionate researcher and hacker-in-residence working at the intersection of AI, security, and embedded systems. I believe in learning by breaking things and helping others do the same. Whether it's performing side-channel analysis on microcontrollers, reverse engineering firmware, or evaluating the ethical bounds of AI in military settings, I’m always up for a challenge that requires deep technical curiosity and social impact.
